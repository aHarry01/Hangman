# Hangman

This is a simple hangman clone implemented in Python, using the built in library tkinter to display the graphics. There is a single player mode, where the program chooses a random word from a dictionary for the player to guess. There is also a 2 player mode, where one player types in a word or phrase that the other must try to guess.

This was coded in early 2018 when I was still in high school. In 2020, I cleaned it up a bit and fixed a lot of the bugs.
